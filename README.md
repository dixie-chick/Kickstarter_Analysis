# Kickstarter_Analysis
This is a data visualization project comparing Kickstarter campaigns to understand what makes a campaign successful.
## How do launch dates and funding goals affect successful Kickstarter fundraising campgains?
The purpose of this project is to compare launch dates, outcomes based on goals, and provide a reccomendation for a successful theater/play campaign.
## Analysis & Challenges
- Limitations: 
  - One data source used
  - Unrefined Categories ie what kind of play?
  - Location to determine success and create a hotspot map
 
Specific US regions are unknown which could help determin hotspots to focus campaigns on. Donation amounts are unkown which would portray any outliers through a box and whisker plot in the event success came from one donor, skewing data for sucessful campgains.


## What was found?

- The most _successful_ play campaigns can mostly likely be launched in May, however the majority of _failed_ play campaigns also occured in May:

_**We should also evaluate outcomes based on funding goal_

- The most _successful_ play campaigns had a funding goal <$1000, while the highest number of _failed_ campaigns occurred between $45,000-$50,000:

- A box and whisker plot on length of campaign to express successful campaigns shows the average campaign lasting 30 days:

## A successful campaign can be launched in Spring and Summer with a goal less than $1,000 especially the month of May.
