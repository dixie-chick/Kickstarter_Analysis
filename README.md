# Kickstarter_Analysis
This is a data visualization project comparing Kickstarter campaigns to understand what makes a campaign successful.
## How do launch dates and funding goals affect successful Kickstarter fundraising campgains?
The purpose of this project is to compare launch dates, outcomes based on goals, and provide a reccomendation for a successful theater/play campaign.
## Analysis & Challenges
- Limitations: 
  - One data source used
  - Unrefined Categories ie what kind of play?
  - Location to determine success and create a hotspot map

## What was found?

- The most _successful_ play campaigns can mostly likely be launched in May, however the majority of _failed_ play campaigns also occured in May:

_**Therefore, we must also evaluate outcomes based on funding goal_

- The most _successful_ play campaigns had a funding goal <$1000, while the highest number of _failed_ campaigns occurred between $45,000-$50,000:

- A box and whisker plot on length of campaign to express successful campaigns shows the average campaign lasting 30 days:

## Is it successful to launch a play campaign <$1,000 during the month of May?

We do not know if specific US regions have influence nor amounts based on donor. If specific regions were had, hotspots of successful areas to launch could be mapped. With donation amounts, box and whisker plots could indicate average amounts to ensure majority is not funded by outliers.
